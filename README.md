# python_automata

Librairy in python to manipulate deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata (herefore referenced has DFA and NFA). 

Supports :
- Simulation of DFA and NFA
- Creating NFA from
- Operators betweens DFA ()
- Multiple minimization algorithms
-  ...

See file doc/index.html for complete documentation and examples.

Basic code for DFA and minimization algorithms maded by comes from andrewb :
